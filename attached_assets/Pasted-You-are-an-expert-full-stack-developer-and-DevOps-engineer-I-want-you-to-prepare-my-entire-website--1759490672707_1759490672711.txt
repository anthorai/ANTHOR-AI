You are an expert full-stack developer and DevOps engineer. I want you to prepare my entire website project for deployment without any errors. Follow these exact steps and ensure production-level readiness:

Code Audit & Error Fixing

Scan all frontend and backend code for syntax errors, broken imports, unused variables, missing dependencies, and incorrect paths.

Optimize and refactor code where needed to prevent runtime crashes.

Ensure all routes/pages/components are connected and functional.

Environment Configuration

Set up a .env file for API keys, database credentials, and sensitive configs.

Ensure no secrets are hardcoded in the codebase.

Use environment variables for production build.

Dependencies & Build Check

Run npm install (or yarn install) to verify all dependencies are installed.

Remove unnecessary or unused packages.

Run npm run build (or framework-specific build command) and confirm there are no errors/warnings.

Database & API Readiness

Verify database connection string and ORM/SQL migrations.

Test all API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for proper responses.

Ensure error handling and fallback mechanisms are in place.

UI/UX & Responsiveness

Test responsiveness across desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Verify that all components (Navbar, Sidebar, Footer, Forms, Buttons, Modals) render correctly.

Check for broken links, missing images, or unstyled components.

Performance Optimization

Minify CSS/JS for production.

Enable caching, compression (gzip/brotli), and image optimization.

Check for Core Web Vitals: load speed, responsiveness, and stability.

Security Hardening

Prevent XSS, CSRF, and SQL injection vulnerabilities.

Use HTTPS-ready configuration.

Hide server errors from the client side.

Testing & Debugging

Run unit tests and integration tests.

Add console error checks and remove unnecessary logs.

Ensure the app runs locally in production mode (npm run start after build).

Deployment Setup

Prepare configuration for hosting (Vercel, Netlify, AWS, or your chosen provider).

Add correct build and start scripts in package.json.

Verify that static assets are correctly linked and served.

Ensure routing works with client-side navigation and server fallback (e.g., Next.js, React Router).

Final Checklist Before Push

npm run lint → No lint errors.

npm run build → No build errors.

npm start → App runs smoothly in production mode.

Git repo is clean, updated, and ready for git push.

Finally, output a deployment-ready version of the project with zero errors, optimized performance, clean code, working build, and production configurations.
