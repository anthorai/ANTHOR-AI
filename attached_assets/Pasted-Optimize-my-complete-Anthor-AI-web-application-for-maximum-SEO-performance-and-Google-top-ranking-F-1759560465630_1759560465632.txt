Optimize my complete Anthor AI web application for maximum SEO performance and Google top ranking.
Follow these detailed requirements step by step:

1️⃣ TECHNICAL SEO OPTIMIZATION

Add meta titles (60–70 characters) and meta descriptions (155–160 characters) for every main page (Home, About, Products, Services, Blog, Contact).

Add canonical tags to prevent duplicate content.

Create a robots.txt file that allows all main pages to be crawled but blocks admin or private routes.

Generate a dynamic XML sitemap that automatically updates with new blog posts or product pages.

Use Next.js dynamic routes and server-side rendering (SSR) for SEO-friendly URLs (e.g., /products/zyra-ai-suite instead of /product?id=123).

Implement Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for social sharing previews.

Add alt text for all images with descriptive and keyword-rich content.

Optimize all images with lazy loading and next-gen formats (WebP).

Use schema markup (JSON-LD) for:

Organization (Anthor AI)

Product (ZYRA Shopify Suite)

Article (Blog posts)

FAQ (if applicable on product or service pages)
