You are a full-stack web developer and UI/UX designer working on the Anthor AI blog section.
Currently, the blog homepage has three cards:

AI News ‚Äì 12 articles

Product Updates ‚Äì 8 articles

Business Insights ‚Äì 15 articles

Now update the app to make these cards clickable, so when a user clicks on a card, it opens a dedicated page showing posts related to that category.

üß± Implementation Requirements
1. Structure

Create three new pages under the /blog directory:

/blog/ai-news

/blog/product-updates

/blog/business-insights

Each page should:

Fetch and display relevant articles dynamically (use mock data for now).

Have a clean, professional layout consistent with the main blog theme.

Include:

A hero section (title, subtitle, background banner).

A responsive grid of article cards (image, title, date, short description, ‚ÄúRead More‚Äù button).

A breadcrumb navigation (Home > Blog > [Category]).

SEO-optimized titles and meta descriptions.

2. Design Style

Follow Anthor AI brand styling (Cyberwave dark theme).

Background: #0D0D1F

Text: Light gray #EAEAEA

Accent: #00F0FF (Neon Azure)

Hover effect on article cards: neon glow border.

Use smooth fade-in animation for content loading.

Implement pagination if articles > 10.

Add a sidebar (optional) showing related tags, popular posts, and newsletter signup.

5. Optional Enhancements

Add a search bar on each page to filter articles by title or keyword.

Integrate an AI summary block (powered by Anthor Guide AI) that summarizes the most trending article in each category.

‚úÖ Final Developer Prompt Example

‚ÄúUpdate the Anthor AI blog system by adding three category pages: AI News, Product Updates, and Business Insights. Each card on the main blog page should link to its dedicated page. Each category page must include a hero section, dynamic article cards, SEO metadata, and follow the Cyberwave dark theme with responsive neon styling. Use mock JSON data for now and ensure smooth navigation and animations. Each article should have its own slug-based detail page for reading full content.‚Äù
